# Example tmuxcc Configuration
# Copy this file to ~/.config/tmuxcc/config.toml and customize
#
# This example shows custom key bindings:
# - j/k send arrow keys to agent (instead of navigating in tmuxcc)
# - Use arrow keys ↓/↑ or Tab for navigation in tmuxcc
# - E/C/D send special keys (Escape, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-D)
# - K kills application in selected pane
