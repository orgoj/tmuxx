## Summary

Four diary entries from a single day of tmuxcc development reveal key patterns around task list management, commit workflow discipline, and UI design decisions. The most critical insight is around unauthorized modifications to TODO.md - one session saw unauthorized removal of a TODO section which caused user frustration. Multiple sessions successfully used the tmuxcc-commit skill, validating its effectiveness.

The sessions covered: line truncation fixes (UI), TODO verification tasks, session rename planning, and full project translation to English. Each session demonstrated the importance of explicit user approval before making changes to shared/tracking files.

## Patterns Identified

### Strong Patterns (3+ occurrences)

1. **tmuxcc-commit skill usage** (3/4 entries)
   - Observation: Skill consistently followed for pre-commit workflow
   - CLAUDE.md rule: Already documented - no change needed

2. **Git status verification before commit** (3/4 entries)
   - Observation: One entry mentioned accidental staging of diary files
   - CLAUDE.md rule: `- Before committing: verify git status for unexpected staged files (hooks may stage files)`

### Emerging Patterns (2 occurrences)

1. **TODO.md modification discipline** (2/4 entries)
   - Observation: Session d2989955 made unauthorized removal of TODO section; session 143f5478 properly handled TODO updates
   - CLAUDE.md rule: `- NEVER modify TODO.md without explicit user approval - report findings first, then ask what to do`

2. **Ask for clarification instead of assuming** (2/4 entries)
   - Observation: Session e3ef5961 initially misunderstood "cary" as borders; session d2989955 assumed "check" meant "remove"
   - CLAUDE.md rule: Already addressed by existing pitfall about asking use case - no change needed

### Rule Violations Detected

1. **Unauthorized TODO.md modification** (session d2989955)
   - Existing implicit rule: Don't make destructive edits
   - Violation: Removed TODO section without user approval
   - Action: Add explicit rule to Common Pitfalls section

## Proposed CLAUDE.md Updates

### Common Pitfalls (add as item 16)
```
16. **TODO.md Unauthorized Modification**: NEVER modify TODO.md without explicit user approval - when asked to "check" or "verify", report findings and ASK what to do next
```

### Development Workflow > Plan Review and Correction Cycles (update existing)
```
- Before committing: verify `git status` for unexpected staged files (diary hooks, other sessions may stage files)
```

## One-Off Observations

1. **Session b2629bff**: Key binding format `C-x` for Ctrl+X established - could document in config section if key bindings become a pattern
2. **Session e3ef5961**: Ratatui wrapping behavior confirmed (omit `.wrap()` to disable) - already documented
3. **Session 143f5478**: `git commit --only <file>` for selective commits - already documented

## Skills/Commands Feedback Applied

All feedback indicated skills working well - no changes needed:
- `.claude/skills/tmuxcc-commit/SKILL.md` - Working correctly (3 sessions)
